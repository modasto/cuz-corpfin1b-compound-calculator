# cuz-corpfin1b-compound-calculator
Python calculator that can compute either the Future Value (FV) or Present Value (PV) of an investment

• The calculator prompts the user to choose whether they want to calculate FV or PV.
• If the user chooses FV, the program asks for the present value (PV), the interest rate (r) as a decimal, and the time (t) in years.
• If the user chooses PV, the program asks for the future value (FV), the interest rate (r) as a decimal, and the time (t) in years.
• The program then computes and displays the result rounded to two decimal places.
• Input validation to ensure the user inputs the correct choice and valid numerical values.
